# Network-Traffic-Analysis-and-Filtering-Using-Wireshark
 You are tasked to capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark. This  involves capturing Ethernet packets, applying filters to detect HTTPS traffic, and identifying IP  addresses for specific websites to enhance your understanding of network traffic dynamics. <br>
 
Project Agenda 
>> To demonstrate packet capture and filtering and analyze network traffic dynamics. <br>
Tools required <br>
>> Wireshark <br>
Expected Deliverables<br>
>> Capture Wireshark files, filter HTTPS packets, identify IP addresses, and document insights on network traffic dynamics <br>
Steps to be followed:  <br>
1. Capture packets using the Wireshark tool  
2. Use a display filter to detect HTTPS packets 
3. Visit a web page and detect its IP address using a display filter
Step 1: Capture packets using the Wireshark tool
